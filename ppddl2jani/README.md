Description

Tool that translates PPDDL [1] to Jani [2].

PPDDL parser is taken from Probabilistic Fast Downward [3,4]. The support of
conditional effects is limited.



Compilation and installation

This translator consists of a python module (the PPDDL compiler), and a C++
module (the Jani instance generator). The C++ module can be compiled by running
make in jani/.

Dependencies: python2.7 lib-boost



Usage

python ppddl2jani.py --jani [destination] [path-to-ppddl-domain] [path-to-ppddl-problem]

where
    [path-to-ppddl-domain] gives the path to the PPDDL domain specification
    file.  This parameter is optional, if omitted the script tries to find the
    domain file corresponding to the given problem file automatically.

    [path-to-ppddl-problem] gives the path to the PPDDL problem specification
    file.

    [destination] gives the destination file to which the Jani output will be
    written. If omitted, the Jani output will be written to
    [path-to-ppddl-problem].jani.
